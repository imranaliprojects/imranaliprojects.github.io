In this code snippet, I created a bar graph to represent the mean MPG for all vehicle models between the years 1973-1974 by number of cylinders. As expected, a larger number of cylinders correlated with a lower MPG.

I then identified the vehicle model which had the largest power-to-weight ratio for 1974-1974. This was the Maserati Bora.

Finally, I created a bar plot to display the power-to-weight ratios of the five vehicle models with the largest power-to-weight ratios.
