#MPG by number of cylinders:
#---------------------------

# This method was adapted from an example on Statology:
# https://www.statology.org/r-mean-by-group/
df <- aggregate(mpg, by=list(cyl), FUN=mean)
#This is used to find average MPG by number of cylinders. 

View(df) #To determine which Columns need to be renamed.

names(df) <- c("# of Cylinders", "Average MPG") #To rename both columns.

#Graphing results, which show expected results:
barplot(df$`Average MPG`, names.arg = df$`# of Cylinders`,
        main = "Relationship Between # of Cylinders and Fuel Economy",
        xlab = "Number of Cylinders",
        ylab = "Average Fuel Economy (MPG)")
