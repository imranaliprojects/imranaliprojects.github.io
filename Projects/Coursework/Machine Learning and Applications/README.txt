This is the first assignment I completed for "Machine Learning and Applications".

For the first task, I used a decision tree classifier to predict whether wine was "high" or "low" using factors such as acidity.

For the second task, I used another decision tree classifier to determine whether sounds had nasality using how loud each harmonic, or extra pitches on top a base frequency (Shimazu, 2021) (Cappel & Sintra, 1993).
